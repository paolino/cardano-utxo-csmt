Module      : Cardano.UTxOCSMT.Application.ChainSyncN2C
Description : N2C ChainSync client receiving full blocks

Node-to-client ChainSync delivers full blocks directly (not headers),
so there is no need for a separate BlockFetch protocol. This module
provides a ChainSync client that feeds blocks directly to the
existing 'Follower'/'Intersector' abstractions.

This is simpler than the N2N path: blocks go directly from
ChainSync to the follower, with no queue or BlockFetch protocol.
